# Skin Cancer Classification

This project was a part of the course ("Machine learning") during my 
degree at GNDU, Amritsar. The data and objective are pulled from the 
[2017 ISIC Challenge on Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma 
Detection](https://challenge.kitware.com/#challenge/583f126bcad3a51cc66c8d9a). 
This repository contains the jupyter notebook which can be used in 
Google colab easily. The documentation is brief though.
